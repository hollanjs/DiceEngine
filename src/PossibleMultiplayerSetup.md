Below is a conceptual outline of how you could structure a multiplayer module for your dice game engine. It’s designed so other developers can import and use the engine in their own networked games, allowing multiple players on different clients to connect and play together.

```
my_dice_game_engine/
    dice/
        die.py
        dice.py
        roll_manager.py
        # etc...
    multiplayer/
        server.py
        client.py
        game_lobby.py
        game_manager.py
    # ...other modules as needed
```

## High-Level Design

1. **Server Module (`server.py`)**  
   - Listens for incoming client connections (e.g., via TCP sockets or WebSockets).
   - Maintains a global or per-lobby “Game State” that includes references to:
     - Active players (their IDs or connection objects).
     - Current dice and roll history (provided by your engine’s `Dice`, `Die`, and `RollManager` classes).
     - Turn order or real-time events as needed.
   - Broadcasts state updates to all connected clients when players roll dice or change game state.

2. **Client Module (`client.py`)**  
   - Connects to the server and sends/receives updates (e.g., which dice were rolled, whose turn it is).
   - Interacts with the local instance of the engine as needed (e.g., if the client manages any local rolls).
   - Provides a simple API for the UI layer or CLI to do things like:
     - “Join a game lobby.”
     - “Roll dice now.”
     - “Read the latest roll or game updates.”

3. **Game Lobby / Session Manager (`game_lobby.py`)**  
   - Manages separate “rooms” or “lobbies” for each instance of a game.
   - Creates a new “Dice Game Session” each time players want to start a new match.
   - Keeps track of:
     - Who is in each session.
     - The state of each session (in progress, waiting for players, finished, etc.).

4. **Game Manager / State Logic (`game_manager.py`)**  
   - A higher-level class that orchestrates the dice logic, networking calls, and overall game flow.
   - Might handle:
     - Turn-based progression, ensuring that each connected client gets a chance to roll.
     - Player input validation (e.g., ensuring it’s a valid time for the player to roll).
   - Could integrate your `RollManager` class to handle “roll with advantage/disadvantage” logic server-side.

## Typical Flow

1. **Server Startup**  
   - `server.py` starts listening on a given port.
   - It initializes the `GameLobby` or similar structure to keep track of separate game sessions.

2. **Client Connects**  
   - A client runs `client.py` and connects to the server. 
   - The client either joins an existing lobby or creates a new one.

3. **Game Creation**  
   - When all required players have joined, `game_manager.py` sets up the `Dice` objects (possibly using `RollManager`) and initializes the turn order or any special rules.

4. **Gameplay**  
   - When a player rolls dice:
     1. The client sends a request to the server (e.g., a “roll” command).
     2. The server processes the request using `RollManager` (normal, advantage, disadvantage, etc.) and updates the game state accordingly.
     3. The server broadcasts the new state (e.g., the roll outcome, updated totals) to all clients in that lobby.

5. **Updating Clients**  
   - Each client receives the broadcast, updates its display or local data structures, and shows the result (rolled value, new totals, next player’s turn, etc.).

6. **Completion**  
   - When a game ends, the server can close out that session. Clients can choose to remain connected to join other games or disconnect.

## Key Considerations

- **Real-Time vs. Turn-Based**  
  - If the game is turn-based, the server enforces who rolls next and prevents out-of-turn actions.  
  - If real-time, it might allow multiple simultaneous rolls or events, updating all clients accordingly.

- **State Synchronization**  
  - The server is the authoritative source of truth. Whenever a roll occurs, the server updates the official state, then pushes that to clients.  
  - Clients might maintain a shadow copy for local display, but final results always come from the server.

- **Security & Validation**  
  - Ensure no client can “fake” a roll. All dice results come from server-side logic, so the server alone calls `die.roll()`.
  - Optionally, you might sign or hash data if clients do partial rolling, but typically the server handles all rolling for fairness.

- **Scalability**  
  - For a larger audience, you might add concurrency handling (threads, async) or distribute across multiple servers.  
  - A simple implementation might suffice for small groups.

- **Persistence**  
  - If games can be resumed later, the server could store state in a database or file. `Dice` and `Die` objects could be serialized as needed.

## Example Pseudocode: `server.py`

```python
import asyncio
from .game_lobby import GameLobby

class DiceGameServer:
    def __init__(self, host='0.0.0.0', port=9000):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port
        self.lobby = GameLobby()

    async def handle_client(self, reader, writer):
        # Perform handshake, gather user info
        while True:
            data = await reader.read(100)
            if not data:
                break
            message = data.decode()
            response = self.process_message(message)
            writer.write(response.encode())
            await writer.drain()
        writer.close()

    def process_message(self, message):
        # Interpret commands, e.g., "JOIN lobby_id" or "ROLL" etc.
        # Interact with self.lobby or the active game manager
        # Return a response
        return "OK"

    def start(self):
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        server_coroutine = asyncio.start_server(self.handle_client, self.host, self.port, loop=loop)
        server = loop.run_until_complete(server_coroutine)
        print(f"Server started on {self.host}:{self.port}")

        try:
            loop.run_forever()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            pass
        finally:
            server.close()
            loop.run_until_complete(server.wait_closed())
            loop.close()
```

## Example Pseudocode: `client.py`

```python
import asyncio

class DiceGameClient:
    def __init__(self, host='127.0.0.1', port=9000):
        self.host = host
        self.port = port

    async def send_message(self, msg):
        reader, writer = await asyncio.open_connection(self.host, self.port)
        writer.write(msg.encode())
        await writer.drain()
        data = await reader.read(100)
        print("Server response:", data.decode())
        writer.close()
        await writer.wait_closed()

    def roll_dice(self):
        asyncio.run(self.send_message("ROLL"))

    def join_lobby(self, lobby_id):
        asyncio.run(self.send_message(f"JOIN {lobby_id}"))
```

This is just a sketch of how you might wire things up. In a real system, you’d likely use a more robust communication protocol (such as JSON over WebSockets), along with structured messages representing actions (roll dice, freeze dice, etc.) and server responses. You’d also integrate your existing `Dice` classes on the server side to track and broadcast game state after each action.
